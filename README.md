# Semantic-Web School Crime London
A semantic web project with multiple data sources and triple store usage.

The Semantic-Web School Crime London is a study project. The purpose of this project is to give indications whether it is true or not that violent video games are causing higher crimes of violence rates near schools.

## What is happening?

The application requests diffrent data sources (e.g. [Datastore Police UK](http://data.police.uk)) and creats a turtle dump with the received data. Followed by sending the dump file to a Triple Store (currently for [Fuseki Jena](http://jena.apache.org)) over HTTP.

After this the application requests a SPARQL query and processes the results as a CSV file.

## Technical 

* [query.rq](Query/query.rq) contains the complete SPARQL query
* [Ontology Folder](Ontology/) contains all create OWL ontologies 

This application is also an working example for a modular architectural design concept from Uncle Bob aka Robert C. Martin.

Further, the article in [objc.io](http://www.objc.io) about [VIPER](http://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/) was a great implementation help.
Finally, the single modules were generated by the [viper-module-generator](https://github.com/teambox/viper-module-generator).
